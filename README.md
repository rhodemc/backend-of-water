## Description

I was motivated to create an ORM ECommerce Backend because it is a convenient way to create, read, update, and delete products, categories, and tags. It is a great tool for any business owner who wants to keep track of their inventory.

## Installation

Once the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the correct file path in your command terminal and enter 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. Once installed, navigate to the db folder, and using your command terminal, login to your mySQL server and run 'SOURCE schema.sql;' to create the database. Return to the root folder and run 'node seeds/index.js' to populate the database with sample data.

## Usage and Testing

Once necessary dependencies are installed, run 'npm start' in your command terminal to start your local server. Open Insomnia and navigate to your localhost port. Now you are able to read, create, update, and delete products, categories, and tags using the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

Future updates will include a kickass front-end and messages in Insomnia confirming the success of each request.
